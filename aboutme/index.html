   <h2>Ed Coleman</h2>

   <p>
    I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology and/or Proferssional Studies.

   <p>
    I have several decades of experience in building, configuring and supporting 
    computers, and now want to learn more about how to program them to help others.

    I have been married for about 47 years and we have five children and eleven
    grandchildren. They all live in various states of the US.
