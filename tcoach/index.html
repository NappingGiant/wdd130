            Hello! My name is Tara Billman and I hold a Bachelor's Degree in
            Home and Family Life from BYU and a Certified Life Coach Credential 
            through the International Coaching Federation.
          </p><p>
            Before my husband and I started our family, we never imagined we would 
            have a child with Tourette Syndrome and that our other three children 
            would also end up with at least one physical or mental health 
            diagnosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            After our oldest daughter was diagnosed with TS in 2013, I struggled 
            for years trying to control things I couldn't control and at times 
            felt hopeless and defeated. I also struggled to make decisions about 
            things I could control. I didn't know how to let myself feel or 
            process feelings so I stuffed them, and I didn't make self-care a 
            priority.
          </p><p>
            I can trace the beginnings of my battle with anxiety to around this 
            time period. Constantly worried about the future of my children and 
            what they were going through. Always in fight or flight mode. It was 
            exhausting.
          </p>

          <h4>Then in 2021 I discovered life coaching…</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>I learned to recognize and acknowledge what was actually in my control.</li>
              <li>I learned how to feel and process my feelings.</li>
              <li>I learned to prioritize self-care.</li>
              <li>I learned that my thoughts affect my results.</li>
              <li>I discovered my core values and strengths.</li>
              <li>I learned how to let some things go, like what other people think or say.</li>
              <li>And I learned how to trust myself again.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>As a result of these breakthroughs…</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>I am willing to be more vulnerable and admit when I need help.</li>
              <li>I can better manage my feelings, including the anxiety.</li>
              <li>I am able to choose which thoughts I hold onto and let go of the others.</li>
              <li>I feel better because I'm taking better care of myself.</li>
              <li>I am able to make decisions more easily, based on my values.</li>
              <li>I am more present with my family.</li>
              <li>And I am able to show up as a parent the way that I want to, with confidence and peace.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
