            <h3>Program F A Q</h3>
            <p>
             
             <b>What is life coaching anyway?</b>
             A life coach is essentially a thinking partner. I guide you to using 
             your own creativity and resources to see beyond any blocks you might 
             have and solve your own problems. I do this through asking powerful 
             questions, reflecting, observing and summarizing to help you clarify 
             and evaluate your thinking. I hold space for you to explore the gap 
             between where you are now and where you want to be, and provide 
             mindset tools and skills to help get you there. Your job as the client
             is to be vulnerable and honest, willing to explore what isn't clear 
             about yourself, others, or a situation. Also to be willing to put in 
             some work in between sessions because that is where the real growth 
             happens!
            </p><p>
             <b>What does a private life coaching call look like?</b>
             The weekly calls will be 60 minutes in length. We will spend time 
             addressing your main challenges and helping you get clarity and tools 
             to navigate them. A lot of shifts happen on these calls so come p
             repared to have your mind blown.
            </p><p>
             <b>My plate is full and I just want someone to talk to. Is homework required?</b>
             No. If I offer something as “homework” during a session it is always 
             optional. The action steps YOU develop and commit to during a session 
             may be all you need to move forward.
            </p><p>
             <b>How will the monthly payments be charged to my account?</b>
             You will be emailed a bill every 30 days that you can pay by credit 
             or debit card.
            </p>
