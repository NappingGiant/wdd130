Are you tired of watching your child suffer from the effects of 
Tourette Syndrome and feeling powerless to help them? Do you long to 
feel confident and peaceful when it comes to parenting your child?

If so, this program is for you!

I see you mom…

 - Your child has been diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome and you 
    don’t know how to help them.
 - You find yourself Googling all things related to the diagnosis.
 - Your friends and family and the school think your child should be 
    able to control their tics and they try to give you parenting 
    advice.
 - You find yourself waking up at two in the morning worrying about how 
    you are going to keep it all together and how to best help your 
    child while showing up for your other children too.
 - You wish you were connected to other women who have gone down this 
    road and could be a support to you right away, but you don’t know 
    where to find these people.
 - You are having a hard time getting the doctor to listen.
 - No one gets you.
 - People say they are sorry and to let them know what you need, but 
    YOU don’t even know what you need, let alone have the ability to 
    delegate anything to anyone else.

What you will get with this program:

 - You will gain clarity around how to parent your child with TS.
 - You will feel more confident in decisions you are making about your child’s treatment.
 - You will learn to manage your thoughts and emotions in a way that gets the results you want in your life.
 - You will feel more centered and balanced as you parent your other children.
 - You will learn how to find joy and fun in life.
 - You will feel more confident in communicating with friends, family and other people who interact with your child.
 - You will learn how to establish strong boundaries with other people without feeling guilty.
 - You will have more clarity on how to balance other areas of your life.
 - You will have more peace, be able to see your strengths and live a more intentional life.
 - You will learn how to take better care of yourself so you can fill your cup and give to those you love.

You might be asking yourself, how do I KNOW that this is for me?

 - This is for you if you are feeling frustrated, hopeless, lost or defeated.
 - This is for you if you are struggling to make decisions about your child’s care.

 - This is for you if you want to connect with a mom who can relate.
 - But most importantly, this is for you if you want to feel more confident and peaceful in parenting your child.

Program FAQ


What is life coaching anyway?
A life coach is essentially a thinking partner. I guide you to using 
your own creativity and resources to see beyond any blocks you might 
have and solve your own problems. I do this through asking powerful 
questions, reflecting, observing and summarizing to help you clarify 
and evaluate your thinking. I hold space for you to explore the gap 
between where you are now and where you want to be, and provide 
mindset tools and skills to help get you there. Your job as the client
is to be vulnerable and honest, willing to explore what isn't clear 
about yourself, others, or a situation. Also to be willing to put in 
some work in between sessions because that is where the real growth 
happens!

What does a private life coaching call look like?
The weekly calls will be 60 minutes in length. We will spend time 
addressing your main challenges and helping you get clarity and tools 
to navigate them. A lot of shifts happen on these calls so come p
repared to have your mind blown.

My plate is full and I just want someone to talk to. Is homework required?
No. If I offer something as “homework” during a session it is always 
optional. The action steps YOU develop and commit to during a session 
may be all you need to move forward.

How will the monthly payments be charged to my account?
You will be emailed a bill every 30 days that you can pay by credit 
or debit card.
