Are you tired of watching your child suffer from the effects of 
Tourette Syndrome and feeling powerless to help them? Do you long to 
feel confident and peaceful when it comes to parenting your child?

If so, this program is for you!


 - Your child has been diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome and you 
    don’t know how to help them.
 - You find yourself Googling all things related to the diagnosis.
 - Your friends and family and the school think your child should be 
    able to control their tics and they try to give you parenting 
    advice.
 - You find yourself waking up at two in the morning worrying about how 
    you are going to keep it all together and how to best help your 
    child while showing up for your other children too.
 - You wish you were connected to other women who have gone down this 
    road and could be a support to you right away, but you don’t know 
    where to find these people.
 - You are having a hard time getting the doctor to listen.
 - No one gets you.
 - People say they are sorry and to let them know what you need, but 
    YOU don’t even know what you need, let alone have the ability to 
    delegate anything to anyone else.

Hello! My name is Tara Billman and I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in
Home and Family Life from BYU and a Certified Life Coach Credential 
through the International Coaching Federation.

Before my husband and I started our family, we never imagined we would 
have a child with Tourette Syndrome and that our other three children 
would also end up with at least one physical or mental health 
diagnosis.

After our oldest daughter was diagnosed with TS in 2013, I struggled 
for years trying to control things I couldn’t control and at times 
felt hopeless and defeated. I also struggled to make decisions about 
things I could control. I didn’t know how to let myself feel or 
process feelings so I stuffed them, and I didn’t make self-care a 
priority.

I can trace the beginnings of my battle with anxiety to around this 
time period. Constantly worried about the future of my children and 
what they were going through. Always in fight or flight mode. It was 
exhausting.

Then in 2021 I discovered life coaching…
 - I learned to recognize and acknowledge what was actually in my control.
 - I learned how to feel and process my feelings.
 - I learned to prioritize self-care.
 - I learned that my thoughts affect my results.
 - I discovered my core values and strengths.
 - I learned how to let some things go, like what other people think or say.
 - And I learned how to trust myself again.

As a result of these breakthroughs…
 - I am willing to be more vulnerable and admit when I need help.
 - I can better manage my feelings, including the anxiety.
 - I am able to choose which thoughts I hold onto and let go of the others.
 - I feel better because I’m taking better care of myself.
 - I am able to make decisions more easily, based on my values.
 - I am more present with my family.
 - And I am able to show up as a parent the way that I want to, with confidence and peace.

Now I know exactly how to support and guide you as you navigate the life changes that come with your child’s TS diagnosis.

If you are a mom whose child has been diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, I want to let you know that I have been where you are.
I get you. I see you and I feel you.

And I have created a coaching package that is tailor made just for you!

Life Coaching offers solutions to a lot of things that YOU struggle with as you try to help alleviate your child’s suffering.
