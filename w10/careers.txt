What did you learn from the websites on careers in web design and development?

From the listings, it appears that a significant number of skills are needed in site developer tools: HTML, Java, PHP, JSP, ASP.NET, Python, and AJAX were mentioned, and I’m aware of others that are used (i.e., Django, node.js). Although these weren’t necessarily listed as requirements for entry-level jobs, they are required for career advancement as an e-commerce site developer. That said, it appears that advancement in the field could be fairly rapid, almost doubling in four to seven years. The pay is pretty good, as well!


What did you learn from this class in general?

CSS is a powerful tool! I learned basic HTML when the web was still new, and the capabilities that CSS provides has changed most of my assumptions about how to design a web site. Also, based on a browsing of the W3schools.com HOW-TO section that was recommended in the lesson it appears that the use of Javascript is common even in the simplest of sites even with the capabilities of CSS. I also learned the importance of color. I struggled to get colors that worked well together, even with the sites and tools that were provided. This class has already helped me considerably in creating a useful site at one of the places I volunteer.
